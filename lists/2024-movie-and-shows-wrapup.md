# 2024-movies-and-shows-wrapup

hello 2024 is coming to an end and i wanted to just lay out everything i watched this year that i would suggest watching.

## Shows
1. Succession 
	a show centered around a rich ass family and they fight over who gets to run the family company. Despite not being a comedy, i think it's got the best comedy from a show i've seen. Witty dialogue, interesting characters and dramatic storytelling. honestly, still my favourite show to this day.


2. Arcane Season 2
	I didn't watch arcane season 1 until i heard that a second season was coming and boy oh boy. Best thing I ever decided to do. It manages to tie together so many different characters into one somewhat coherent story. I think with shows like this the main selling point is the relationships of the characters, how they interact with one another. I'm still never playing league though.
	
3. The bear 
	jeremy allen white plays a hot and traumatised chef. it's about ambition and the cost of ambition. how in the pursuit of achieving greatness we have to make sacrifices, and what that does to a mf. it's not on the same level as the other shows on this list but boy oh boy does this show stress me out.

4. Devilman Crybaby
	I mean i'm not sure what the ending is about but like the literal demonisation of a minority and scapegoating them for all the issues of the world is like pretty obvious in terms of metaphors go. facism lives inside all of us or something. Recommended for eva fans, maybe y'all can tell me what it's about.

5. Ping Pong the Animation
	yes the anime about table tennis but it's not just that ok. i swear it's more than just a table tennis anime. it's not even a sports anime cuz all other sports anime is ass when compared with this. This is art that makes proper use of the medium, you wouldn't get it. HEHEHEH.

## Movies
1. Look Back 
	this is my movie of the year honestly, it's almost an hour long. That's ridiculously short for a movie. A love letter to art and the story of two girls growing up together. It's a burst of life and i cried like a bitch. (also the music is goated in this one)

2. Perfect Days
	putting this on here because i wanna be a pretentious little film guy too. A move away from the traditional "our hero has a big goal, and they'll do anything to achieve it". This is like lowkey boring. I mean it's more like mundane and there's something calming and meditative about the movie. A reminder to focus on the now, involve yourself in the process of living and not get caught up in your goals. I had to watch it separately because i got bored.

3. Jojo Rabbit
	ah yes the atrocities of nazi germany told through the lens of a young child. it's actually really entertaining to watch this kid struggle against his internal facist. It's a heartwarming movie you can watch with your family.  

4. Chungking Express
	genuinely was not expecting the film to be in chinese. I mean put it on for a first date. it's really fun and light-hearted and I'm not being ironic about that. This movie has maybe some of the most goofy and memorable dialogue.

5. Black Swan
	This one's for my goat Contrapoints.
	It's the embodiment of ambition and the struggle to achieve that ambition. The conflict between the apollonian and the dionysian, spongebob vs squirdward instinct. definitely scared me more than i thought it would. it's like lowkey too spooky.
